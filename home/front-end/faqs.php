								<div class="tab-btn"><a href="#">Why do the prices in the shop sometimes change?<em class="mdi mdi-plus"></em></a> </div>
								<div class="tab-content">
								<p>Many of the magazines that we sell are from far-away countries. Prices depend largely on factors such as the shipping cost, customs duties, and general price changes imposed by our suppliers and the individual publishers. We therefore have to pass any changes in costs on to our customers. For subscription orders, however, the prices are not changed until the subscription is renewed. The prices at the time of ordering always apply.</p>

We’re always pleased to add new magazines that have been funded in this way, and we’ve even helped support some of them ourselves.</p>

								<div class="tab-btn"><a href="#">Why do some of your prices differ from those of other retailers?<em class="mdi mdi-plus"></em></a> </div>
								<div class="tab-content">
								<p>Our retail prices are based on the trade price that we pay per magazine. We also have to take into account various other factors such as customs duties and shipping costs. These are especially high for magazines ordered from the USA or Australia, for example, and have to be considered in the final price. We also put a lot of time and effort into presenting each magazine in an optimum way in our shop and on social media. All of these factors therefore have to be taken into account when calculating the individual prices.</p>
